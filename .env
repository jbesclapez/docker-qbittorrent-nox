# === qBittorrent Environment Variables ===

# Legal Notice Confirmation:
# This variable is required to acknowledge qBittorrent's legal notice.
# The value "confirm" ensures the notice is accepted during startup.
QBT_LEGAL_NOTICE=confirm

# qBittorrent Version:
# Specifies the version of qBittorrent to build and run in the container.
# Example: "5.0.3" corresponds to qBittorrent release 5.0.3.
QBT_VERSION=5.0.3

# WebUI Port:
# Defines the external port used to access qBittorrent's WebUI on the host.
# This is mapped to the container's internal WebUI port (default: 8080).
# Example: Set to 8085 to avoid conflicts with other services using port 8080.
QBT_WEBUI_PORT=8085

# Configuration Path:
# Specifies the host directory where qBittorrent's configuration files are stored.
# Ensure this path exists and is writable by the container's user.
# Example: `/volume2/docker/qbitorrent/config` on a Synology NAS.
QBT_CONFIG_PATH=/volume2/docker/qbitorrent/config

# Downloads Path:
# Specifies the host directory where torrent downloads are stored.
# Ensure this path exists and is writable by the container's user.
# Example: `/volume2/docker/qbitorrent/downloads` on a Synology NAS.
QBT_DOWNLOADS_PATH=/volume2/docker/qbitorrent/downloads

# User ID (PUID):
# Specifies the user ID for the container's non-root user (qbtUser).
# Match this to the user ID of the account managing the files on the host.
# Example: 1029 is the user ID of `jbesclapez` on your Synology NAS.

# How to find PUID:
# 1. SSH into your Synology NAS using a terminal or SSH client.
# 2. Run the `id` command with your username:
#    id <your-username>
#    Example: id jbesclapez
# 3. Note the UID value in the output:
#    uid=1029(jbesclapez) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),101(administrators)
# 4. Use the `uid` value as the `PUID` (e.g., 1029).
PUID=1029

# Group ID (PGID):
# Specifies the group ID for the container's non-root user (qbtUser).
# Match this to the group ID of the account managing the files on the host.
# Example: 100 corresponds to the `users` group on your Synology NAS.

# How to find PGID:
# 1. Use the same `id` command as above:
#    id <your-username>
# 2. Note the GID value in the output:
#    uid=1029(jbesclapez) gid=100(users) groups=100(users),101(administrators)
# 3. Use the `gid` value as the `PGID` (e.g., 100).
PGID=100

# Time Zone:
# Sets the container's time zone to match your local environment.
# Use a valid timezone string (e.g., "Europe/Paris") to ensure accurate timestamps.
# Example: "Europe/Paris" sets the time zone to Paris, France.
TZ=Europe/Paris
